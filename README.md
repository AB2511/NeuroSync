# NeuroSync: A BCI-Powered Focus Assistant

## Overview
NeuroSync is an innovative machine learning application that classifies EEG (electroencephalogram) signals as "Focused" or "Distracted" using a Random Forest model trained on the EEGMAT dataset (72 EDF files from 36 subjects). Achieving 94% accuracy, this project simulates brain-computer interface (BCI) input with pre-recorded EEG data, with future plans to integrate real-time BCI hardware such as Muse or NeuroSky. Developed by Anjali in July 2025, NeuroSync highlights expertise in EEG signal processing, machine learning, and web application development.

## Features
- **Focus Detection**: Accurately classifies EEG data into "Focused" or "Distracted" states with 94% accuracy.
- **EEG Preprocessing**: Implements bandpass filtering (0.5â€“40 Hz), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with 15 components, Welch Power Spectral Density (PSD), and 189 features including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band powers, mean, variance, and band ratios (theta/beta, alpha/beta).
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit, featuring visualizations for confidence scores, time-series trends, and frequency band powers.
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision/Recall/F1 scores: 0.96/0.97/0.96 (Distracted), 0.90/0.87/0.89 (Focused).
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the EEGMAT dataset (21 channels, 128 Hz sampling rate).

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **EEG Processing**: MNE-Python (filtering, ICA)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning)
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Joblib

## Setup and Installation
To run NeuroSync locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AB2511/NeuroSync.git
   cd NeuroSync
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run neurosync.py
   ```

4. **Upload Required Files**:
   - Download `focus_classifier_rf (1).pkl` and `sample_eeg (1).csv` from [Google Drive link] and upload them via the app interface.

## Usage
- Upload the pre-trained model file `focus_classifier_rf (1).pkl` and a 21-channel EEG CSV file (e.g., `sample_eeg (1).csv`).
- The app will display the focus state ("Focused" or "Distracted"), model accuracy (94%), and interactive visualizations including confidence scores, time-series trends, and frequency band powers.

## Future Work
- Integrate real-time BCI hardware (e.g., Muse, NeuroSky) for live focus monitoring.
- Develop a mobile application to enhance accessibility.
- Explore deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs) to improve classification accuracy.

## Project Structure
- `neurosync.py`: Main Streamlit application script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes large files (e.g., `.pkl`, `.csv`) from version control.
